    "introText": "At Genmypass, we take your privacy very seriously. This policy describes what data we process, how we protect it, and what rights you have as a user. Genmypass is a zero-knowledge password manager: your passwords and sensitive data are encrypted on your device and are never accessible to us.",

    "dataCollectedItem1Title": "OAuth authentication data",
    "dataCollectedItem1Text": "When you connect Google Drive or Dropbox, we receive a temporary access token to operate with your cloud storage. This token is managed through our OAuth proxy (Cloudflare Worker) and is stored exclusively in your browser.",
